# SemanticStrap

SemanticStrap is a frontend "framework" for quickly adding a neat look and feel to web projects. It aims to have the convenience of frameworks like Bootstrap but using only semantic HTML for styling and vanilla Javascript for interactive widgets.

## Using it

If you want to use SemanticStrap in your project, just download `semstrap.min.css` and add it to your HTML files like this:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../semstrap.min.css">
```
That's it. Take a look at the docs to see the cool stuff you can build with pure HTML elements and SemanticStrap.


## Building it

Want to create your own flavour of SemanticStrap. Go ahead:

You'll need to have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) installed to build Semantic Strap yourself. Then you can clone the project and run the gulp task to create a new build of semstrap.min.css in the `dist` directory.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/iamfrank/semantic-strap.git // Clone the SemanticStrap git project
```
