        Semstrap (or "semantic bootstrap") is a collection of CSS styles that add a modern look and feel to web projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        It aims to have the convenience of frameworks like Bootstrap but using only semantic HTML for styling and vanilla Javascript for interactive widgets.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many developers turn to frontend frameworks just to easily improve the looks of their web projects. Unfortunately this approach results in a loot of framework-specific code like class names and wrapping elements being added to your HTML. Sometimes you even end up adding a bit of code from a another web project that relies on a different front end framework and you get a mess of dependencies and conflicting class names.
    </p>
    <p>
        Semstrap styles only targets elements. When you want to use it to style a form element you just add the element like so:
    </p>
    
    {% highlight html %}
<form>
    <label for="inputEmail">Email address</label>
    <input id="inputEmail" type="email">
</form>
    {% endhighlight %}
    
    <p>
        ... as opposed to:
    </p>
    
    {% highlight html %}
<form class="form form-modifier">
  <div class="form__wrapper form__wrapper-modifier">
    <label class="form__wrapper__label" for="exampleInputEmail1">Email address</label>
    <input class="form__wrapper__input form__wrapper__input-modifier" type="email" class="form-control">
  </div>
</form>
    {% endhighlight %}

    <h3>Using it</h3>
    <p>
        If you want to use Semstrap in your project, just download semstrap.css from here and add it to your HTML files along with a link to the Open Sans font from Google Web Fonts:
    </p>
    
    {% highlight html %}
<link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:400,700'>
<link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='semstrap.css'>
    {% endhighlight %}
    
    <p>
        That's it. Take a look at <a href="{{ '/pages/elements.html' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">the docs</a> to see the cool stuff you can build with pure HTML elements and Semstrap.
